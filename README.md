# High-performance Matrix Multiplication in Z/pZ with Floating Structure

This repository contains high-performance implementations of matrix multiplication in the finite field Z/pZ with a floating structure. The project is being undertaken during my research internship at LIP6, under the supervision of Jeremy Berthomieu. The internship is taking place from July 2023 to August 2023.
