# High-performance Matrix Multiplication in Finite Field with Floating Coefficients

This repository contains high-performance implementations of matrix multiplication in a finite field with floating coefficients. The project is being undertaken during my research internship at LIP6, under the supervision of Jeremy Berthomieu. The internship is taking place from July 2023 to August 2023.
